My mom is white, and she’s never really been in touch with her Norwegian or German roots. We make a couple dishes that are Norwegian, but that’s kind of it. My grandma and my dad were both born in the Philippines so they keep up more with their tradition. I do feel bad sometimes when I’m with my mom, and on a questionnaire, I’m asked to select a race. I select ‘Filipino,’ and my mom’s sitting right there. In a way, that’s kind of invalidating her. People would come up to me and ask ‘What are you?’ It gets kinda annoying because when I tell them, they either like ‘Oh, that’s cool.’ or shrug it off like &nbsp;they know everything about me. The world’s so diverse that you shouldn’t have to make those kind of choices and pick just one thing to identify yourself. The more I think about it, the more problems I can find with how mixed people tend to be addressed, but at the same time, I do the same thing when I can’t pinpoint where someone’s exactly from. It’s just curiosity. You can’t really blame people for that. That’s just human nature, I guess.”<br></p>

                        <p class="card-text">“One of my favorite moments from the Dominican Republic was on a holiday that is unique to the region I was living in. In English, it’s called the “The Twenty Fourth of Bathing.” &nbsp;In the morning, everyone in the community goes to the river to bathe all afternoon. One of my best friends wanted me to go to the river with her. She was about twelve, and she’s one of the girls I spent most of my time with. I got there a little before four and she was just finishing up. She said something in Creole. She said, ‘Chita, Natalia.’, which means sit down. So, I grabbed a chair and sat down, and the look on her face was like so impressed. The girl didn’t expect me to know what that meant. She was like, “Oh my god, Natalia knows!” So of course, she started saying other things to me in Creole, but I had no idea what she was saying. I liked how she was there with her friend and they looked at each other in amazement. I think it increased their trust of me by seeing that I was making an effort to live like they do and understand and speak their language. Then we went to the river, and there were a bunch of kids there jumping around. It was fun.&nbsp;<br></p>

For a long time, I didn’t have a male role model growing up. It’s challenging. You don’t really have an example of a healthy relationship or marriage. My mother was working about three jobs when I lived with her in Clarksville, Tennessee. It was a ghost town with a military base. We didn’t have a lot of money. When I was nine, my dad came and visited for a week, and at the end of the week, my mom asked if he wanted to take me back home. He said yes. I was little and didn’t think much of it. Oakland very different than the South. In the South, it’s very conservative and traditional, what you’d think what American culture would be. But here, it’s unique. It’s not American in the way you’d think. It’s a very different culture.”<br></p>

Her body wasn’t fighting enough infections. She first got diagnosed when she was seven, and then it went away from five and a half years. But then it came back. My mom was always in and out of the hospital. She was sometimes in there for months and it’d just be me, my sister, and my brother. I remember one time when I was in eighth grade, she spent two months in there for chemotherapy. My tenth grade year, my mom passed away. That was really hard on me. I wasn’t doing so good in school before she passed. I didn’t really come to school. My freshman year, I was a nerd. I wasn’t really into human confrontation. For lunch, I used to run across the street, go get my food, and run back across the street to class. My summer after ninth grade, I started getting new friends, hanging out with new people. I started getting more social to fit in. I used to skip class. I didn’t do no work. Hang in the hallways, be across the street, be at Lee’s. I guess it was peer pressure. I had to be cool to hang out with them. They didn’t go to class; I didn’t go to class. But after my mom passed, I had to change. Because I knew all she wanted me to do was to graduate and get on out of here. My brother and sister ahead of me came to Tech, but they had to transfer.

I was just going to goof off and get on out of there. But then after being in that class, it was scarier than anything. I’m sitting there in his class, and I got a black teacher. I could relate to him, and that made me more comfortable. From talking to him, he was just hecka cool. The knowledge he was giving us about history. You can’t know yourself without history. Without me knowing my history, I wouldn’t have known I was from greatness. I could really succeed. That’s what we learned. We need history to go forward.

In my generation, as soon as you graduate high school, you’d go into the workforce. There wasn’t much talk about going to college and having a degree. It took me a little while to understand that. Going into the workforce, I saw that there were people I was clearly smarter than, but I needed that piece of paper, that degree, to compete. My gift of gab could only go so far. Charm could only go so far.

I’m not like the traditional teacher. I'm building a social and emotional development within the classroom and teaching students how to advocate for themselves. I'm also creating a system and structure for them to be educated on their ancestral culture and create a sense of independence within themselves by incorporating rituals and customs that aren’t usually brought up in a traditional classroom setting. With the 2016 graduating class, we went through a change and metamorphosis of all these students growing to be something great. There was a number of students featured in the Oakland Tribune and New York times. There was a film doc that came out at the end of the year. And to see the change in them moving from tenth to twelfth grade and now college handling it on their own, it was phenomenal.”</p>

It’s nice to see the young kids dress professionally or business casual. It’s a confidence builder. When students come into the class, there’s a different poise, a different stature they hold. You see it from a Wednesday when they’re dressed in regular clothes to a Thursday when they’re dressed up. There’s a little bit of a glow. I look at it as in: They never know who might walk through that door and have an opportunity for them. I don’t want them to pass by or slip into the cracks. I always want them to be the ones those people look at first. When a CEO or district official comes in, they might have a job, and I want them to be the first in line. My coach used to make us do that when it was game day. We have a college knowledge workshop where a cohort of teachers comes in and talks about how to get into college. When they’re learning about how to get into college, they’re dressed up for the seminars. They’re dressed up for game day. My students have an innate sense of greatness. I think that they are all prodigies. I think that they are scholars and kings. We identify our students as kings because of the simple fact that they are royalty and that they need to be cherished as royalty. When they know that they have that feeling from an adult or peers, it boosts their confidence level and establishes a strong bond of trust.”<br><br>What is one piece of advice you give to your students?<br><br>“You’ll always have ninety nine problems if you can’t keep it one hundred. If you can’t be real, if you can’t be 100% about everything, there’s always ninety nine problems. You want to make sure that your voices, writing, the way you affect change is 100% because you have to be out there to upset a setup. It’s plain and simple.”<br></p>

We didn't really notice. We didn't know what they were going through because they tried to keep it from us. But, they would come home after so many months and look so tired in really cheap, raggy clothes. We were just really happy to see them. I was in fourth grade when I first recall it actually affecting my life. My brother and sister were in middle school, and I remember it was after my dad and brother's birthday party. I went to sleep over at my best friend's, and the next morning, my mom came to pick me up. It was kind of funny because we were like, 'Oh, maybe if I hide, I won’t need to leave and we can stay at your house for the rest of the day.' But I got scared, so I left with my mom. I remember entering the house to see my brother and sister leaning against the bed, crying, and then I realized what was going on. When my mom told me they took my dad, I didn't understand. They said 'immigration,' and that word was so new to me in fourth grade. That night, our dad called us from Tijuana late at night. He said immigration was coming after my mom. She woke us all up to pack our lightest, and we left the house. It was scary. I didn’t know what was going on. <br>We went to go live with my uncle. It was a bit of a blur but I remember my dad coming back and going to work the next morning with my uncle. Then my mom got a call again from my dad and he told my mom that he got caught again by immigration with my uncle this time. He told her to come or they’ll go to the house. That wasn’t a good thing because my aunt isn’t from here. Neither are my older cousins. They’re all from Mexico, and the only people born here are me, my youngest cousin, my brother, and the little ones who were five at the time. We went to and I really regret going . It gave me nightmares when we saw what was going on. I saw my dad handcuffed against a car. The siren was going on, but I couldn’t see my dad as a criminal. I knew what handcuffs meant. They were talking, and my mom said she couldn’t leave because she had to take care of me and my siblings. But she had no choice but to put us up for adoption, foster care, or leave us with someone who’s a U.S. citizen. So my brother and sister stayed while they took me to Mexico because I was the youngest. I ended up living there for a year. "<br></p>

My dad wasn’t able to get here on time but he came back in August for my brother’s birthday. Then they came back in time for my brother’s high school graduation. They were here, and we were doing good. It wasn’t too bad, and we were happy. Freshman year, I had my fifteen here. It was a really great moment. Then I remember a couple months later when my parents were talking to us about having to leave the country again. But they weren’t getting deported this time. They had to leave on their own because my brother was at the age where he can vouch for my parents but they couldn't be in this country. They had to leave during my sophomore year, and it was really hard. My grades fell because I got into depression. There was a time last year where I had a fear of living from house to house. When my parents left, my aunt didn’t want us living with her because she was a very grumpy lady. So we moved to live with this really wicked woman whom we didn’t know at all. She turned out to be really crazy. One morning, I didn’t really want to talk because I’m not much of a morning person. I wasn’t really responding to her, and she got really angry and kept yelling at me with a knife in her hand . When we got the opportunity to move, we moved again. Right now we’re okay. Hopefully, we don't have to move again. We’re still saving up money to get a lawyer for my parents. I had to give up so many things to work. I had to give up soccer and volleyball because I don’t have time. I have time for karate, though, because my schedule balances out with that. One really painful thing I had to give up was my dog. I couldn't keep her anymore. I really loved her and she kept me sane most of the time."</p>

My brother’s the reason why green is my favorite color, why I love tea, and the reason why I’m interested in literature. When I call them, I always cry as I hear their voices. Sometimes I feel like I don't have the right to cry because I can see my parents by raising enough money. But, my sister can’t and I can’t do anything about it. Just recently, we made enough money for me to see my parents in October. I’m really happy to be going back. My dad got sick with a hernia and he had to get surgery in Mexico. He’s always talking about how he's gonna die. I don't know why he kept on saying that. I like to think he was joking around but I don't know. Just seeing them would be a sense of relief. <br>I always saw them as strong people. They’re willing to go through the border so many times for their kids. That shows a lot. They've survived snakes, scorpions, and all those terrible things that could've killed them. My parents have talked about crossing the border again, but why? Why do that again if you are not as young as you are before. I don’t really want them to go through that again, but it’s been almost three years since I’ve seen them. It’s been a long time. I really miss them sometimes. I really need them here."<br></p>

At the time, we didn’t know that they were the Riders, a group of corrupt police officers. They were banging at our door, and they snatched my dad out of the house. I watched them load a gun on top of their car, and they charged my dad with having a loaded gun in possession. They loaded it and said it was my dad's. They got some random person on the street and told that person to say that he saw my dad dealing drugs. After I watched them load a gun on the hood of their car, I watched them beat my dad on the street while he was in handcuffs. I remember sitting there on the stairs , crying, because I didn't know what as going on. I was four or five years old. They had my mom in handcuffs too. She didn't do anything. I remember one of the officers yelling at me saying that I would go to jail too if I didn't stop crying. So I tried to stop crying while they beat my dad.

This is the egg. It’s turning around looking at its back. It’s symbolizing what I’m doing today. I’m learning everything from my ancestors and bringing it back to the new age to teach the youth.”<br></p>

When she went in for surgery, I said I would get a tattoo for her. I got it, and they managed to get the tumor out. She survived. She’s five now, a kindergartener. I love her very much. She gets me up in the morning. Knowing that she fought through that obstacle while knowing that she might not have a life at all drives me to get up in the morning and take everyday by storm. Before I had a 2.5 GPA. Now I’m at a 3.2.”<br></p>

We talk once or twice a week. He’s supportive in anything I do and provides wisdom and a different form of love that can’t be substituted by my mom. Family is an important value to me. I cherish it more because you don’t know what you have until it’s gone. In the future, I don’t want my family to go through a single mother household. You understand what a single mother goes through. I’ve grown to respect and cherish her even more. I admire her. It’s not easy being a single mother. You see that she has to work harder to care for the household. Day in and day out, we go through it together. At the end of the day, it’s just me and her. Everyday, we’re there for each other. It creates a strong bear bond. Now that I’m getting older and wiser, I’m starting to realize I have to take a bigger role in the household and take initiative. I go to school everyday and work once a week on Sundays. When I come home from work, I go straight to sleep. Sometimes I barely even do my homework. I realized my mom works five days out of the week and that it’s not easy as I thought it was.”<br></p>
