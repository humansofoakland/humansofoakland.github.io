There were people wearing rainbow flags, so I’m assuming it provoked his response and attitude towards the LGBT community because he immediately goes saying ‘F the LGBT community.’ He kept saying that if you’re gay then you should go to hell, that the only acceptable members of the community were lesbians. Because they were considered an acceptance because of sexual arousal. That student even referred to one of my peers as a, excuse my language but, ‘transfaggot.’ Just to hear homophobia rather than see it behind a screen is so much more impactful. It hurts so much more. Why this particular incident stood out is because no one spoke out. Not even the substitute teacher said anything. None of my classmates said anything. Even after I told that person to stop saying these things about a community that doesn’t concern him, no one spoke up afterward. It doesn’t necessarily surprise me, but it amazes me. My school is generally liberal, but there is still so much discrimination occurring. I wish people would use their voice they used at the walkout within their classrooms, within their homes, and the environment they’re always in to speak up against racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, instead of letting it slide by.”<br></p>

But once I hit middle school, everyone started to notice and there was a tension around me. People always have that stereotypical view of &nbsp;'Oh, she might be a terrorist. She might have a bomb under her skirt.' The first time was in sixth grade in my math class. I was the type of rumor that everyone was talking about but never talked to me about. It was a guy who came up to me, and he was actually my partner. He had that muggish face like 'Ugh, I have to sit next to her?' We were doing math problems when he said 'What is that? What is that towel?' He was like 'You guys are all the same. You guys are all just going to bomb everything.' I exploded. He called me a terrorist, a towel head. But not all Arabs/Muslims are terrorists. I always feel people look at me differently because I'm not what society sees as normal. But to be honest, I kinda like the stares because now I'm just like, “Look at me darling, I'm beautiful. I don't mind. Keep looking.' In my first game, people were like 'Oh she's the team captain?'

I grew frustrated with the politics and public school system. So, I decided to do research of charter and private schools, and in my research, I found this to be one of the schools that addresses the issues of the achievement gap and structure. These are my proteges. I have a group of 36 outstanding individuals who should leave their mark on making a greater and better society. They’re the reason why I’m here, to be quite honest. Three years ago, I saw so much potential in them, and they had so much potential and a drive to succeed. They reminded me of me when I was in sixth grade, and so I said, ‘If I were to make any type of commitment, long term, that these would be the kids that I would be the ones to make the commitment.’ There are 36 potential leaders, inventors, discovers, mavericks, and pioneers within this group. Doctors, surgeons, and authors. Whatever they chose to be, I know they can be one of the best in their chosen occupations. I plan to lecture and reach an audience greater than 36. This is an exceptional, outstanding class. I have five books in the making. My books would be out already if I didn’t fall in love with this class of 36 students.”</p>

My mother wasn’t having it, and I was sent out on my own when I was 19. I was homeless for half a year. It’s that where you feel as though in Ralph Ellis’s book that you were an invisible person. People just look past you. They don’t look at you. They look past you like you didn’t exist.”<br><br>“How did you pick yourself back up?”<br><br>“When I was giving up on myself, my grandmother and aunts were praying for me. They had faith that God would protect and save me, which he did. Once you hit bottom, you can only go up. My father eventually picked me up. We went to the acorn projects in West Oakland, and I got my degree on the streets. I’ve always grew up in a nice middle class cultured family but I didn’t know how it was like to live at the bottom until I was homeless and lived in the acorn projects. It opened my eyes, and I became tough.<br>Some of these people at school think they’re tough, think they’re gangsters. But you have no idea what being tough is until you live in a community where women are being raped, drug deals are a common place, people are being ripped off, violence and crime is daily experience. The police take their time coming or don’t come at all. You live on food stamps or donations on the church. You’re treated as though you’re less than human, which was how I was treated when I went to social services. People don’t choose to be poor, but it’s because of the way society is set.”<br><br>“What’s one piece of advice you’ve acquired over the years and would share with the world?”<br><br>“Learn to forgive and let go.

I experienced what it was like to be under Jim Crow. I remember African Americans being lynched and burned. I remember it like it was yesterday. I was young at the time but I remember it on the news. It would break my heart when we’re supposed to be in a place called America, the beautiful and justice for all. I didn’t see that growing up. In elementary school, I had Christopher Ho who was Chinese, Hiro Nagafushi who was Japanese, Byron and Bruce who were African American, and Richard who was white. We had the biggest gang at Washington Elementary School. We biked everywhere, went everywhere together, and did everything. I thought that was the way everyone was supposed to live. Until one day I was at Christopher Ho’s house and his mother said in Cantonese, You’re not supposed to be with this black guy.' He teared up in the kitchen of his house because we were friends. This was in fourth grade. He went outside and told me,' You can’t come to my house anymore.' I’ll never forget that day. But, the beauty of it all is that we’re all still friends. One of my biggest struggle growing up in a society like that was deprogramming myself from the hypocrisy of the media and the propaganda of thinking that I’m less of a human being because I’m not born white. Because of that experience, I’ve never felt that anybody should feel superior to others, that no one should be left down because of their culture, race, or sex . I’m against all the -isms because I grew up in that environment and I had great teachers and great schools. I learned that even though we have progressed with an African American president, I see pockets of these situations where we were like back in the 1950s.“</p>

The most influential person to me when she was living was my grandma. She was my nanny. She always doted on me so when I was little and treated me like I was older. When I was five years old, we walked to the bank, and she opened a bank account for me. She bought me my first piggybank. From that day forward, I had a business mind. I counted all the money when the big day came to break my piggybank, wrote down all the figures, and went to the bank. I knew how to collect stamps. When no one would go to church and partied every Saturday and Sunday night instead, she would take me to church on Sunday morning. She taught me the history of my family, that I came from a line of educators where my great grandfather said it was a means of empowerment and liberations. She had a high expectation of me and stressed the importance of giving back.<br>I subbed at a juvenile hall and alternative middle school that was named after President Obama. I remember working with young kids that felt alienated and a stigma attached to being part of an alternative school. They organized, worked hard, and presented to a school board. They had faith, the hope, and the confidence in themselves. They were really proud. The board and even Congresswoman Barbara Lee were there for the dedication. It was a great experience for those kids to see that they can make a difference.<br>I started off as a youth pastor then went to Florida where I worked with the school system to address the issue of why so many kids were failing and doing what they’re not supposed to do. All the schools were failing and not doing so well, at least students of color. I grew disenchanted with the fact that kids were continuing to fail, continuing to drop out, and I thought we weren’t going in the right direction. I found many of the answers in the charter school system. I worked long hours but it’s not about the money. It’s about helping shape young souls, young lives. We are impacting the future.

In between meeting her in high school and marrying her very shortly after, I was drafted into the army. I spent two years in Japan, and she came over to be with me and we were talking about where we wanted to live. Chicago is a very dynamic city and had beautiful weather. It wasn’t much of an inducement stay in Chicago. She had lived in Southern California with her mother. We gravitated towards Southern California, where I finished my college education, my masters degree, my teaching license, and started teaching in Los Angeles. Then we decided the smog was very unhealthy and Marsha, my six footer, was born there and she was almost one year old. We decided we needed to get out of there, health-wise. And we had another child en route. What we were attracted to was Montclair , and we didn’t know it was part of Oakland. We bought a house five days later.”<br></p>

They would have oppressed peoples fighting each other all the time - people who were slaves, or people who were criminalized by their justice system. Some of the same phenomenon happens online. We have oppressed groups of people fighting each other, getting really kind of borderline emotionally abusive with each other.
