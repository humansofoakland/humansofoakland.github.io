                    <p class="card-text">(⅓) “I grew up in a town called King City. I was raised by a single mother. I don’t know my father. It doesn’t bug me at all, but I think it has something to do with why I’m here. I’m the youngest of four boys. My brother gang banged, and I saw my mother cry a lot. I saw her pain. I used to be really bad. I was the bully and picked fights. When I was in sixth grade, I realized what was going on and changed. I started to do better in school. By the end of middle school, I was in the top ten percent of my class. My mom converted to Christianity, and I got baptized. I promised my mom a lot of things, but in high school, things changed. I was a victim of peer pressure and wanting to always fit in. I tried cocaine for the first time when I was in eighth grade, but I didn’t like the feeling. So I started smoking marijuana. By tenth grade, I moved to the west side of my town and got introduced to crystal meth and left marijuana. I started hearing voices and didn’t trust nobody so when I was 16, I asked for help. I ended up moving to Union City for 6 months and moved in with a pastor. After six months, I thought I was ready to move back to my town, but I just started getting back to the same things. In the summer of 2006 when my brother got married, my cousin heard what was happening to me and asked my mother if she could take me back to Sacramento. So I moved to Sacramento and graduated high school, but I was still using. I started experimenting with ecstasy, but I eventually went back to crystal meth. In 2011, I was 22 at the time. I got incarcerated for the first time, and I went to prison. I was selling methylamine and ended up getting set up by the buyer. I got caught with a quarter pound, and I was sentenced to three years with halftime. After I got out, I didn’t get in trouble the whole year. I thought I was done with that life. I moved back to my hometown and started seeing old friends. But little by little, I started selling again and it went on for three years.”<br></p>

                        <p class="card-text">(⅔) “On Thanksgiving of 2014, I received a phone call from my ex-girlfriend. We hadn’t seen or talked to each other for a whole month. That morning, she told me she was pregnant. I asked her how she knew. She said it was the second test and it had come up positive. She later moved in with me. She was already seven months pregnant. My daughter, Camila, was born July 21, 2015.  A month later, I ended up telling her to leave because she was physically abusing me. Hitting a girl is not in my genes. I was raised by a single mother and I would never hit a woman. It started off as verbal, talking smack to me. Eventually, it got physical. But at the same time, I was using methylamine and trying to numb out my feelings. My daughter was old enough to remember you if she saw you two days ago. I couldn’t let her see her mother beat me up. So, I told her mother to go back home, and she gained a big resentment. She wouldn’t let me see my daughter until I move out of King City and stopped selling drugs. So, I stopped selling but the addiction still continued. I couldn’t stop using. On October 12, I got incarcerated again because I had failed to appear at a probation meeting. Two days before my court date, I asked them for a program because no matter what I tried, I couldn’t see my daughter. Not only that, but I wasn’t providing for her or my daughter. I needed to get my life straight because with no job, no money in my pocket, I somehow managed to still be using. I realized that was wrong and as a man with a kid, I wasn’t doing what I was supposed to be doing. I grew up without a dad. I didn’t want my daughter growing up without her father. That little girl needs her dad. And I need her. Not being with her right now hurts me. She’s young. She’s only fifteen months. She probably won’t remember me. My ex blames me and my addiction. She says I’m weak because I need a program to help me with my addiction. I tried, I really did, but it’s an addiction some of us can’t. We’re powerless. Everyone’s wired differently.”<br></p>

                        <p class="card-text">(3/3) “On October 23, they picked me up and brought me here to Cityteam. I don’t know what the Lord has in store for me, but this whole month I’ve been here has been great. I’ve been blessed. I have 36 days sober. I’m not counting but it’s something I cherish. They say here, ‘Don’t count the days, make the days count.’ That’s what I’m trying to do everyday. It’s a process of humbling myself through helping feed the community everyday, working. In the program, people pointed out I have a positive attitude. I never thought I did because I was always high. I never really knew myself. Coming here, I began to see myself in a new light. I came here primarily for my daughter, but God has blessed me. I’m leaving it up to God. There’s a scripture in the Bible that says, ‘Take delight in the Lord and he will give you what your heart desires.’ I’m really standing by that verse and hopeful I can get not my whole family back, but at least my daughter.”<br></p>
