                    <p class="card-text">(⅓) “I grew up in a town called King City. I was raised by a single mother. I don’t know my father. It doesn’t bug me at all, but I think it has something to do with why I’m here. I’m the youngest of four boys. My brother gang banged, and I saw my mother cry a lot. I saw her pain. I used to be really bad. I was the bully and picked fights. When I was in sixth grade, I realized what was going on and changed. I started to do better in school. By the end of middle school, I was in the top ten percent of my class. My mom converted to Christianity, and I got baptized. I promised my mom a lot of things, but in high school, things changed. I was a victim of peer pressure and wanting to always fit in. I tried cocaine for the first time when I was in eighth grade, but I didn’t like the feeling. So I started smoking marijuana. By tenth grade, I moved to the west side of my town and got introduced to crystal meth and left marijuana. I started hearing voices and didn’t trust nobody so when I was 16, I asked for help. I ended up moving to Union City for 6 months and moved in with a pastor. After six months, I thought I was ready to move back to my town, but I just started getting back to the same things. In the summer of 2006 when my brother got married, my cousin heard what was happening to me and asked my mother if she could take me back to Sacramento. So I moved to Sacramento and graduated high school, but I was still using. I started experimenting with ecstasy, but I eventually went back to crystal meth. In 2011, I was 22 at the time. I got incarcerated for the first time, and I went to prison. I was selling methylamine and ended up getting set up by the buyer. I got caught with a quarter pound, and I was sentenced to three years with halftime. After I got out, I didn’t get in trouble the whole year. I thought I was done with that life. I moved back to my hometown and started seeing old friends. But little by little, I started selling again and it went on for three years.”<br></p>

                        <p class="card-text">(⅔) “On Thanksgiving of 2014, I received a phone call from my ex-girlfriend. We hadn’t seen or talked to each other for a whole month. That morning, she told me she was pregnant. I asked her how she knew. She said it was the second test and it had come up positive. She later moved in with me. She was already seven months pregnant. My daughter, Camila, was born July 21, 2015.  A month later, I ended up telling her to leave because she was physically abusing me. Hitting a girl is not in my genes. I was raised by a single mother and I would never hit a woman. It started off as verbal, talking smack to me. Eventually, it got physical. But at the same time, I was using methylamine and trying to numb out my feelings. My daughter was old enough to remember you if she saw you two days ago. I couldn’t let her see her mother beat me up. So, I told her mother to go back home, and she gained a big resentment. She wouldn’t let me see my daughter until I move out of King City and stopped selling drugs. So, I stopped selling but the addiction still continued. I couldn’t stop using. On October 12, I got incarcerated again because I had failed to appear at a probation meeting. Two days before my court date, I asked them for a program because no matter what I tried, I couldn’t see my daughter. Not only that, but I wasn’t providing for her or my daughter. I needed to get my life straight because with no job, no money in my pocket, I somehow managed to still be using. I realized that was wrong and as a man with a kid, I wasn’t doing what I was supposed to be doing. I grew up without a dad. I didn’t want my daughter growing up without her father. That little girl needs her dad. And I need her. Not being with her right now hurts me. She’s young. She’s only fifteen months. She probably won’t remember me. My ex blames me and my addiction. She says I’m weak because I need a program to help me with my addiction. I tried, I really did, but it’s an addiction some of us can’t. We’re powerless. Everyone’s wired differently.”<br></p>

I don’t know what the Lord has in store for me, but this whole month I’ve been here has been great. I’ve been blessed. I have 36 days sober. I’m not counting but it’s something I cherish. They say here, ‘Don’t count the days, make the days count.’ That’s what I’m trying to do everyday. It’s a process of humbling myself through helping feed the community everyday, working. In the program, people pointed out I have a positive attitude. I never thought I did because I was always high. I never really knew myself. I came here primarily for my daughter, but since coming here, I began to see myself in a new light. God has blessed me. I’m leaving it up to God. There’s a scripture in the Bible that says, ‘Take delight in the Lord and he will give you what your heart desires.’ I’m really standing by that verse and hopeful I can get not my whole family back, but at least my daughter.”<br></p>

No one knew the consequences back then. Everyone wanted to have fun and go out to parties. I didn’t want to stop. I went to all the clubs when I was in my twenties. Thought it was cool. It later dragged on until I was addicted. It became a habit and I wanted it all the time. It didn’t really cause problems until I was in my forties. I’ve never been to prison. I’ve walked all my life, but in my forties, it just wasn’t working anymore. I didn’t take it seriously that I had a problem until maybe five years ago.

Some of them gave up on life. Some had mental issues. It gave me a little more understanding and compassion towards them. I realized I’m no better than them no matter what. I got saved 26 years ago. I tried to live in two worlds: the world and all that it has to offer and church. It took all these years to come to a point of how I’m going to live. &nbsp;I decided to live my life as a Christian.

They slowed down my promotions.  But, nothing happened to him.  He was a CHP officer.  Afterwards, he went to Desert Storm and embarrassed the entire team.  He turned out to be a coward and got out of the military with dishonorable discharge.  It went on his permanent record, but it didn’t matter when he went home because he was still a CHP officer.  There should have been a way out for me.  I should have benefits and stuff like that.  But the same information in the database that was in there in 1989 is not there anymore.  I was already trained to be a police officer but I didn’t go into that field, which made it hard for me to get a job.  Everything I saw and witnessed really put a bad taste in my mouth about the police in general.  They’re arrogant, cocky, racist, prejudice, and discriminate on all class, sex, color, religion.  75% of them are like this.  That leaves 25% core, good people that protect and serve the people.

Over the last thirteen years, I’ve had eight surgeries, and they’ve slowly built up over time. Oxycon, narcos, Vicodin. I’m pretty responsible when it comes to work and being on time, meeting deadlines. But during the last three or four years of it, it started affecting my jobs and school. Vicodin is the same plant as heroin so there’s a big withdrawal with it. So when I woke up every morning, I felt sicker and sicker. Towards the end, I wasn’t taking it for pain. I was taking it to feel better. I would skip work to get more Vicodin. When you look at my transcript, you can see when I was sober and when I wasn’t. When I was sober, I had all A’s. When I wasn’t, I had C’s and B’s. My mom knew I was spending more money. I paid all my bills, but all my extra money would go towards Vicodin.”<br></p>

I grew up in a house for three years where everybody smoked crack. I’ve always believed in God since I was a little boy. I never went to church too much, but I knew he was there. I remember looking up and cursing to him because my dad was pretty abusive when we were younger. I started smoking weed at twelve with my dad and older sister. I didn’t want to but they peer pressured me into it. It’s hilarious, but not really. You get used to it. It’s weird the stuff you can get used to. It was normal, but eventually, you can’t keep'taking it. It gets too much. So I left when I was 16 to Missouri. At 18, I moved to live with my dad in Southern California. I was working with him, and his boss was this Vietnamese guy named KC at a furniture shop. Horrible temper. This guy was so mean. My dad was already a full blown alcoholic. He was drinking every day, on the job. It was okay with the boss. ‘This is my medicine. I need it,’ he would say. I began drinking with him, daily, at work, and that was when my addiction started. Alcoholism is not a moral issue. It’s a physical allergy. My body responds differently than other people’s does to alcohol. I can’t drink casually. Some people can have a couple drinks, be okay and not want anymore. Other people can’t. When I start drinking, I can’t stop. I don’t have a limit. I can’t drink in moderation. This phenomenon of craving starts where I keep drinking and drinking.”<br></p>

I quit right when we met, and it lasted for six months. Right when we started dating, I said right when I start drinking, it would be the end of our relationship. It was. We were together for three years, but I basically screwed it all up. I stopped after the end of our relationship. But I couldn’t stay sober. I understood the drinking was a big problem and it would mess up our relationship. I grew up with alcoholics. I understand it’s nothing good, but I still drank. I couldn’t stay sober. I was in Oregon when my mom asked me to go to a program with her. She told me I was one of the only people she trusted to go into a program with. But she was dying, and I couldn’t do anything but watch. I couldn’t go to the program with her anyways. I was still drinking and wasn’t ready. I talked to my older sister on New Years of 2015. I was crying to her, telling her about my life. My older sister goes: “You’ll never do what you want to do if you keep drinking.” It hit me. But what really hit me was that she cried. She said, “I miss my brother. I just miss my brother.” She asked me when was the last time I was sober for a year. I couldn’t remember. I was like 12 the last time I was sober for a year. I’m 29 now. I was 27 when she asked me that. I said alright, I’ll go into a program.”<br></p>

I had been sober for four or five months and thought I could help a brother, Evan, who was struggling with alcoholism in Colorado. Marcu said, ‘No you need to come back here and finish what you started.’ One of my great aunts, who I’ve never met, got on the phone with me and told me, ‘If you learn one thing from that program that makes you a better man, then it’s working.’ There’s so much that come with recovery. It’s a whole different world. Recovery and addiction are two different things. I never wanted to get in it. Once I got in, I never thought I would get out. But I did. I’m still nervous. I’m still shaky. My recovery’s not solid. There are no guarantees. I’m still trying to learn how to work the program for a living. Because I’m dysfunctional to a certain degree. I don’t think the same way as other people do. I didn’t grow up with normal parents. I grew up in a broken home. I’m still learning surrender and let my issues all go to God and let him run the show.

My brother had connections with people down here and said, ‘Well, you’ve had the high class one. Now you’re going to do the down-and-dirty rehab -- a little tougher on the streets of Oakland.’ It was funny because it’s a lot easier to recover if you’re living in a condo on a beach on Newport. But I felt like it was kind of a joke. I felt like it was a place where rich parents sent their kids when they didn’t want to deal with them. I don’t know how many of those kids actually recovered, to be honest with you. Probably not many of them. I grew up in Oakland, so I’m not unfamiliar with the nitty-gritty of the streets. This is actually my second time around. I had a problem with methamphetamines. That’s how I ended up here. I graduated from the program about three years ago, had a good job, went out into the world, and started getting a little bit of success. But I didn’t have my connection with God quite right so I started using again and messing around with drugs again. I also had a problem with gambling. I got down to the point where I didn’t have anything. I have a brother whom I’m very close to. I like to joke and say he’s the good brother. He’s always tried to help me in the past. I just turned 57 two days ago. I’m done asking for help from people. I’ve got to do this myself. I can’t ask for my little brother to help me anymore. I remembered Cityteam and came back down here and said, ‘Help me’. We work and serve meals everyday to the homeless. It is a little more… it gave me a close-up of how many people are out there in pain and poverty. It’s just a totally different program. A totally different way of life.”<br></p>

They always say, ‘Trust in God.’ I’ve always had a hard time with that, but now, I’m not too worried about it. I don’t ever expect to be rich. I had my shot at it already. At one time, I had a lot of money and  owned homes, but I don’t need that to be happy anymore, really. I just want to be comfortable. As long as I have a place to live and little bit of money, I know I’ll be okay. Being a multi-millionaire… that’s not really in the future for me, and I don’t need that. Sometimes if I think about it too much, I might work myself up, but I don’t get too concerned about it. God will provide.
