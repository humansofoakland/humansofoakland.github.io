Because they were considered an acceptance because of sexual arousal. That student even referred to one of my peers as a, excuse my language but, ‘transfaggot.’ Just to hear homophobia rather than see it behind a screen is so much more impactful. It hurts so much more. Why this particular incident stood out is because no one spoke out. Not even the substitute teacher said anything. None of my classmates said anything. Even after I told that person to stop saying these things about a community that doesn’t concern him, no one spoke up afterward. It doesn’t necessarily surprise me, but it amazes me. My school is generally liberal, but there is still so much discrimination occurring. I wish people would use their voice they used at the walkout within their classrooms, within their homes, and the environment they’re always in to speak up against racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, instead of letting it slide by.”<br>",

She might have a bomb under her skirt.' The first time was in sixth grade in my math class. I was the type of rumor that everyone was talking about but never talked to me about. It was a guy who came up to me, and he was actually my partner. He had that muggish face like 'Ugh, I have to sit next to her?' We were doing math problems when he said 'What is that? What is that towel?' He was like 'You guys are all the same. You guys are all just going to bomb everything.' I exploded. He called me a terrorist, a towel head. But not all Arabs/Muslims are terrorists. I always feel people look at me differently because I'm not what society sees as normal. But to be honest, I kinda like the stares because now I'm just like, “Look at me darling, I'm beautiful. I don't mind. Keep looking.' In my first game, people were like 'Oh she's the team captain?' They never realized that Muslim girls can be volleyball players. They are able to do what they like to do.\"<br>",

One of my biggest struggle growing up in a society like that was deprogramming myself from the hypocrisy of the media and the propaganda of thinking that I’m less of a human being because I’m not born white. Because of that experience, I’ve never felt that anybody should feel superior to others, that no one should be left down because of their culture, race, or sex .

The most influential person to me when she was living was my grandma. She was my nanny. She always doted on me so when I was little and treated me like I was older. When I was five years old, we walked to the bank, and she opened a bank account for me. She bought me my first piggybank. From that day forward, I had a business mind. I counted all the money when the big day came to break my piggybank, wrote down all the figures, and went to the bank. I knew how to collect stamps. When no one would go to church and partied every Saturday and Sunday night instead, she would take me to church on Sunday morning. She taught me the history of my family, that I came from a line of educators where my great grandfather said it was a means of empowerment and liberations. She had a high expectation of me and stressed the importance of giving back.<br>I subbed at a juvenile hall and alternative middle school that was named after President Obama. I remember working with young kids that felt alienated and a stigma attached to being part of an alternative school. They organized, worked hard, and presented to a school board. They had faith, the hope, and the confidence in themselves. They were really proud. The board and even Congresswoman Barbara Lee were there for the dedication. It was a great experience for those kids to see that they can make a difference.<br>I started off as a youth pastor then went to Florida where I worked with the school system to address the issue of why so many kids were failing and doing what they’re not supposed to do. All the schools were failing and not doing so well, at least students of color. I grew disenchanted with the fact that kids were continuing to fail, continuing to drop out, and I thought we weren’t going in the right direction. I found many of the answers in the charter school system. I worked long hours but it’s not about the money. It’s about helping shape young souls, young lives. We are impacting the future.

They would have oppressed peoples fighting each other all the time - people who were slaves, or people who were criminalized by their justice system. Some of the same phenomenon happens online. We have oppressed groups of people fighting each other, getting really kind of borderline emotionally abusive with each other. The difference between the Colosseum and now is that in the Colosseum, they didn’t really have a choice in fighting one another. But we DO have that choice.

It doesn’t bug me at all, but I think it has something to do with why I’m here. I’m the youngest of four boys. My brother gang banged, and I saw my mother cry a lot. I saw her pain. I used to be really bad. I was the bully and picked fights. When I was in sixth grade, I realized what was going on and changed. I started to do better in school. By the end of middle school, I was in the top ten percent of my class. My mom converted to Christianity, and I got baptized. I promised my mom a lot of things, but in high school, things changed. I was a victim of peer pressure and wanting to always fit in. I tried cocaine for the first time when I was in eighth grade, but I didn’t like the feeling. So I started smoking marijuana. By tenth grade, I moved to the west side of my town and got introduced to crystal meth and left marijuana. I started hearing voices and didn’t trust nobody so when I was 16, I asked for help. I ended up moving to Union City for 6 months and moved in with a pastor. After six months, I thought I was ready to move back to my town, but I just started getting back to the same things. In the summer of 2006 when my brother got married, my cousin heard what was happening to me and asked my mother if she could take me back to Sacramento. So I moved to Sacramento and graduated high school, but I was still using. I started experimenting with ecstasy, but I eventually went back to crystal meth. In 2011, I was 22 at the time. I got incarcerated for the first time, and I went to prison. I was selling methylamine and ended up getting set up by the buyer. I got caught with a quarter pound, and I was sentenced to three years with halftime. After I got out, I didn’t get in trouble the whole year. I thought I was done with that life. I moved back to my hometown and started seeing old friends. But little by little, I started selling again and it went on for three years.”<br>",

That morning, she told me she was pregnant. I asked her how she knew. She said it was the second test and it had come up positive. She later moved in with me. She was already seven months pregnant. My daughter, Camila, was born July 21, 2015.  A month later, I ended up telling her to leave because she was physically abusing me. Hitting a girl is not in my genes. I was raised by a single mother and I would never hit a woman. It started off as verbal, talking smack to me. Eventually, it got physical. But at the same time, I was using methylamine and trying to numb out my feelings. My daughter was old enough to remember you if she saw you two days ago. I couldn’t let her see her mother beat me up. So, I told her mother to go back home, and she gained a big resentment. She wouldn’t let me see my daughter until I move out of King City and stopped selling drugs. So, I stopped selling but the addiction still continued. I couldn’t stop using. On October 12, I got incarcerated again because I had failed to appear at a probation meeting. Two days before my court date, I asked them for a program because no matter what I tried, I couldn’t see my daughter. Not only that, but I wasn’t providing for her or my daughter. I needed to get my life straight because with no job, no money in my pocket, I somehow managed to still be using. I realized that was wrong and as a man with a kid, I wasn’t doing what I was supposed to be doing. I grew up without a dad. I didn’t want my daughter growing up without her father. That little girl needs her dad. And I need her. Not being with her right now hurts me. She’s young. She’s only fifteen months. She probably won’t remember me. My ex blames me and my addiction. She says I’m weak because I need a program to help me with my addiction. I tried, I really did, but it’s an addiction some of us can’t. We’re powerless. Everyone’s wired differently.”<br>",

I’ve been blessed. I have 36 days sober. I’m not counting but it’s something I cherish. They say here, ‘Don’t count the days, make the days count.’ That’s what I’m trying to do everyday. It’s a process of humbling myself through helping feed the community everyday, working. In the program, people pointed out I have a positive attitude. I never thought I did because I was always high. I never really knew myself. Coming here, I began to see myself in a new light. I came here primarily for my daughter, but God has blessed me. I’m leaving it up to God. There’s a scripture in the Bible that says, ‘Take delight in the Lord and he will give you what your heart desires.’ I’m really standing by that verse and hopeful I can get not my whole family back, but at least my daughter.”<br>",

My grandma and my dad were both born in the Philippines so they keep up more with their tradition. I do feel bad sometimes when I’m with my mom, and on a questionnaire, I’m asked to select a race. I select ‘Filipino,’ and my mom’s sitting right there. In a way, that’s kind of invalidating her. People would come up to me and ask ‘What are you?’ It gets kinda annoying because when I tell them, they either like ‘Oh, that’s cool.’ or shrug it off like &nbsp;they know everything about me. The world’s so diverse that you shouldn’t have to make those kind of choices and pick just one thing to identify yourself. The more I think about it, the more problems I can find with how mixed people tend to be addressed, but at the same time, I do the same thing when I can’t pinpoint where someone’s exactly from. It’s just curiosity. You can’t really blame people for that. That’s just human nature, I guess.”<br>",

One of my best friends wanted me to go to the river with her. She was about twelve, and she’s one of the girls I spent most of my time with. I got there a little before four and she was just finishing up. She said something in Creole. She said, ‘Chita, Natalia.’, which means sit down. So, I grabbed a chair and sat down, and the look on her face was like so impressed. The girl didn’t expect me to know what that meant. She was like, “Oh my god, Natalia knows!” So of course, she started saying other things to me in Creole, but I had no idea what she was saying. I liked how she was there with her friend and they looked at each other in amazement. I think it increased their trust of me by seeing that I was making an effort to live like they do and understand and speak their language. Then we went to the river, and there were a bunch of kids there jumping around. It was fun.&nbsp;<br>",

Her body wasn’t fighting enough infections. She first got diagnosed when she was seven, and then it went away from five and a half years. But then it came back. My mom was always in and out of the hospital. She was sometimes in there for months and it’d just be me, my sister, and my brother. I remember one time when I was in eighth grade, she spent two months in there for chemotherapy. My tenth grade year, my mom passed away. That was really hard on me. I wasn’t doing so good in school before she passed. I didn’t really come to school. My freshman year, I was a nerd. I wasn’t really into human confrontation. For lunch, I used to run across the street, go get my food, and run back across the street to class. My summer after ninth grade, I started getting new friends, hanging out with new people. I started getting more social to fit in. I used to skip class. I didn’t do no work. Hang in the hallways, be across the street, be at Lee’s. I guess it was peer pressure. I had to be cool to hang out with them. They didn’t go to class; I didn’t go to class. But after my mom passed, I had to change. Because I knew all she wanted me to do was to graduate and get on out of here. My brother and sister ahead of me came to Tech, but they had to transfer. So I’m gonna be the first one to graduate from Tech.\"",

So I got kicked out of my class and put into Mr. Hancock’s class. They felt his class would help me learn and grow up. <br>At first, in my head, I didn't care. It was just like any other class. I was just going to goof off and get on out of there. But then after being in that class, it was scarier than anything. I’m sitting there in his class, and I got a black teacher. I could relate to him, and that made me more comfortable. From talking to him, he was just hecka cool. The knowledge he was giving us about history. You can’t know yourself without history. Without me knowing my history, I wouldn’t have known I was from greatness. I could really succeed. That’s what we learned. We need history to go forward. If I were to lose my memory right now, I wouldn’t be able to go anywhere. I wouldn’t know where to go without my history. <br>I want other people to know this knowledge. This knowledge is gold.

There’s somebody out in the world that allows me teach children.' That’s the opening joke. I grew up here right around the corner from Tech. Born here, raised here. In my generation, as soon as you graduate high school, you’d go into the workforce. There wasn’t much talk about going to college and having a degree. It took me a little while to understand that. Going into the workforce, I saw that there were people I was clearly smarter than, but I needed that piece of paper, that degree, to compete. My gift of gab could only go so far. Charm could only go so far. It wasn't until the day I sat in my mom's english class and thought, ‘This is something I could do.’ I started out as a student support coach and made the transition to teaching.

I’m not like the traditional teacher. I'm building a social and emotional development within the classroom and teaching students how to advocate for themselves. I'm also creating a system and structure for them to be educated on their ancestral culture and create a sense of independence within themselves by incorporating rituals and customs that aren’t usually brought up in a traditional classroom setting. With the 2016 graduating class, we went through a change and metamorphosis of all these students growing to be something great. There was a number of students featured in the Oakland Tribune and New York times. There was a film doc that came out at the end of the year. And to see the change in them moving from tenth to twelfth grade and now college handling it on their own, it was phenomenal.”",

It’s nice to see the young kids dress professionally or business casual. It’s a confidence builder. When students come into the class, there’s a different poise, a different stature they hold. You see it from a Wednesday when they’re dressed in regular clothes to a Thursday when they’re dressed up. There’s a little bit of a glow. I look at it as in: They never know who might walk through that door and have an opportunity for them. I don’t want them to pass by or slip into the cracks. I always want them to be the ones those people look at first. When a CEO or district official comes in, they might have a job, and I want them to be the first in line. My coach used to make us do that when it was game day. We have a college knowledge workshop where a cohort of teachers comes in and talks about how to get into college. When they’re learning about how to get into college, they’re dressed up for the seminars. They’re dressed up for game day. My students have an innate sense of greatness. I think that they are all prodigies. I think that they are scholars and kings. We identify our students as kings because of the simple fact that they are royalty and that they need to be cherished as royalty. When they know that they have that feeling from an adult or peers, it boosts their confidence level and establishes a strong bond of trust.”<br><br>What is one piece of advice you give to your students?<br><br>“You’ll always have ninety nine problems if you can’t keep it one hundred. If you can’t be real, if you can’t be 100% about everything, there’s always ninety nine problems. You want to make sure that your voices, writing, the way you affect change is 100% because you have to be out there to upset a setup. It’s plain and simple.”<br>",

We didn't know what they were going through because they tried to keep it from us. But, they would come home after so many months and look so tired in really cheap, raggy clothes. We were just really happy to see them. I was in fourth grade when I first recall it actually affecting my life. My brother and sister were in middle school, and I remember it was after my dad and brother's birthday party. I went to sleep over at my best friend's, and the next morning, my mom came to pick me up. It was kind of funny because we were like, 'Oh, maybe if I hide, I won’t need to leave and we can stay at your house for the rest of the day.' But I got scared, so I left with my mom. I remember entering the house to see my brother and sister leaning against the bed, crying, and then I realized what was going on. When my mom told me they took my dad, I didn't understand. They said 'immigration,' and that word was so new to me in fourth grade. That night, our dad called us from Tijuana late at night. He said immigration was coming after my mom. She woke us all up to pack our lightest, and we left the house. It was scary. I didn’t know what was going on. <br>We went to go live with my uncle. It was a bit of a blur but I remember my dad coming back and going to work the next morning with my uncle. Then my mom got a call again from my dad and he told my mom that he got caught again by immigration with my uncle this time. He told her to come or they’ll go to the house. That wasn’t a good thing because my aunt isn’t from here. Neither are my older cousins. They’re all from Mexico, and the only people born here are me, my youngest cousin, my brother, and the little ones who were five at the time. We went to and I really regret going . It gave me nightmares when we saw what was going on. I saw my dad handcuffed against a car. The siren was going on, but I couldn’t see my dad as a criminal. I knew what handcuffs meant. They were talking, and my mom said she couldn’t leave because she had to take care of me and my siblings. But she had no choice but to put us up for adoption, foster care, or leave us with someone who’s a U.S. citizen. So my brother and sister stayed while they took me to Mexico because I was the youngest. I ended up living there for a year. \"<br>",

Then they came back in time for my brother’s high school graduation. They were here, and we were doing good. It wasn’t too bad, and we were happy. Freshman year, I had my fifteen here. It was a really great moment. Then I remember a couple months later when my parents were talking to us about having to leave the country again. But they weren’t getting deported this time. They had to leave on their own because my brother was at the age where he can vouch for my parents but they couldn't be in this country. They had to leave during my sophomore year, and it was really hard. My grades fell because I got into depression. There was a time last year where I had a fear of living from house to house. When my parents left, my aunt didn’t want us living with her because she was a very grumpy lady. So we moved to live with this really wicked woman whom we didn’t know at all. She turned out to be really crazy. One morning, I didn’t really want to talk because I’m not much of a morning person. I wasn’t really responding to her, and she got really angry and kept yelling at me with a knife in her hand . When we got the opportunity to move, we moved again. Right now we’re okay. Hopefully, we don't have to move again. We’re still saving up money to get a lawyer for my parents. I had to give up so many things to work. I had to give up soccer and volleyball because I don’t have time. I have time for karate, though, because my schedule balances out with that. One really painful thing I had to give up was my dog. I couldn't keep her anymore. I really loved her and she kept me sane most of the time.\"",

Why do that again if you are not as young as you are before. I don’t really want them to go through that again, but it’s been almost three years since I’ve seen them. It’s been a long time.

This one day, we were all in the house, me and my brother, my mom and my dad. We were just chilling, watching TV. Then the police were banging on our door. At the time, we didn’t know that they were the Riders, a group of corrupt police officers. They were banging at our door, and they snatched my dad out of the house. I watched them load a gun on top of their car, and they charged my dad with having a loaded gun in possession. They loaded it and said it was my dad's. They got some random person on the street and told that person to say that he saw my dad dealing drugs. After I watched them load a gun on the hood of their car, I watched them beat my dad on the street while he was in handcuffs. I remember sitting there on the stairs , crying, because I didn't know what as going on. I was four or five years old. They had my mom in handcuffs too. She didn't do anything. I remember one of the officers yelling at me saying that I would go to jail too if I didn't stop crying. So I tried to stop crying while they beat my dad. Then they picked him off the ground and threw him in the back seat. His arm was all bloody. That was just one incident.\"",
